    <h2>Roleplaying Etiquette</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Avoid Powergaming:</strong> Don't force your character's actions or abilities onto others without their consent. Roleplay should be collaborative, not competitive.</li>
      <li><strong>No Metagaming:</strong> Do not use out-of-character (OOC) information to your advantage in-character (IC). What your character knows should not be influenced by what you, the player, know.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Roleplay can be slow-paced at times. Be patient and allow others to respond to your actions and messages.</li>
      <li><strong>Personality & Character:</strong> Maintain a clear personality for your character throughout roleplay interactions, unless there's a valid in-character reason for a change. Keep your character's appearance, behavior, and actions with the server's theme and setting and your own character backstory.</li>
      <li><strong>OOC and IC Separation:</strong> Clearly distinguish between out-of-character (OOC) and in-character (IC) conversations and actions. Use brackets or labels if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
